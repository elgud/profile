# Elgud's Profile Page

Elgud is something of a pollymath. People who know her, sometimes treat her as a walking encyclopdia, though there are are loads of things she does not know. In fact she is frustrated because it is just not possible to know everything.

## Current Projects
1. Learn the JAM stack
2. Learn Django
3. Creating an online sensory profiling checklist (in collaboration with Olga Bogdashina). There is a [prototype](https://spcr.aspiedent.net), but this includes just a few senses. 

## Planned Projects (most will probably not happen)
- Create an online autism profiling tool for people to use
- Create an online autism course about the autism profiling tool
- Find a way of creating a social media platform that I might actually want to use. This might not be possible.
